# fcli sc-dast
fcli.sc-dast.usage.header = Interact with Fortify ScanCentral DAST (SC-DAST).
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.0 = The commands in this module allow for interacting with \
  Fortify ScanCentral DAST (SC-DAST). This includes functionality like submitting and \
  managing DAST scan requests and results.
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.1 = %nBefore being able to interact with ScanCentral DAST, \
  a session will need to be created by passing SSC URL and credentials to the 'session login' \
  command in this module. As a best practice, 'session logout' should be run to terminate the \
  session when there are no more activities to be performed.  

# Shared options
fcli.sc-dast.server-queries = Complementary to the -q / --query option (which performs client-side \
  filtering), this option accepts one or more comma-separated ScanCentral DAST request parameters \
  to perform server-side filtering, for example 'searchText=some-text'. See the ScanCentral DAST \
  API documentation for information on which request parameters are supported on individual endpoints. 

# fcli sc-dast session
fcli.sc-dast.session.usage.header = Manage ScanCentral DAST sessions (start here).
fcli.sc-dast.session.usage.description = The session commands allow for managing one or more \
  ScanCentral DAST sessions used to connect to a particular SSC/ScanCentral DAST environment \
  with particular credentials. Potentially you can have multiple open ScanCentral DAST sessions, \
  for example connecting to different SSC/ScanCentral DAST environments like DEV and PROD, \
  or connecting to the same SSC/ScanCentral DAST instance but with different credentials.
  
# Shared login options
ssc-user.0 = SSC user name.
ssc-user.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_USER: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_USER: Only SC DAST commands
ssc-password.0 = SSC password.
ssc-password.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_PASSWORD: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_PASSWORD: Only SC DAST commands
ssc-ci-token.0 = SSC CIToken in either encoded or decoded format.
ssc-ci-token.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Only SC DAST commands

# fcli sc-dast session login
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.header = Create a session for interacting with ScanCentral DAST.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.description.0 = This command stores the SSC and ScanCentral DAST API \
  URL and authentication token in an encrypted session file in the fcli state data folder, for use \
  by other 'fcli sc-dast' commands to connect to the specified SSC/ScanCentral DAST instance. Option \
  values may be passed on the command line or specified through environment variables (common for \
  CI/CD pipeline use) as listed below.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.description.1 = %nWhen logging in with username and password, this \
  command will connect to SSC to generate a CIToken; the user password is not stored by fcli. When \
  logging in with a pre-generated CIToken, this token will be stored as-is. Note that due to SSC \
  limitations, fcli cannot determine when the token will expire.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.description.2 = %nFor interactive use, you may choose to keep the session \
  open until it expires. For CI/CD integrations and other automations, you should always issue a \
  logout command once work is complete. On shared/non-containerized systems, consider setting \
  FCLI_STATE_DIR or FCLI_DATA_DIR environment variables to prevent unexpected interactions between \
  different pipelines.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.expire-in = Specify for how long the session should remain active, for example \
  1d (1 day), 2M (2 months), 1y (1 year).
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.ssc-url.0 = SSC URL.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.ssc-url.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_URL: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_URL: Only SC DAST commands

# fcli sc-dast session logout
fcli.sc-dast.session.logout.usage.header = Terminate ScanCentral DAST session.
fcli.sc-dast.session.logout.usage.description = This command terminates a ScanCentral DAST session \
  previously created through the 'login' command. This command will try to revoke the token passed \
  to or generated by the 'login' command (unless the --no-revoke-token option is specified), and \
  removes the session data from the fcli state data directory. 
fcli.sc-dast.session.logout.no-revoke-token = Don't revoke the token passed to or generated by the 'login' \
  command. If user name and password were specified during login, it is recommended to have the 'logout' \
  command revoke this token, to avoid exceeding SSCs maximum token limit. Note that due to SSC limitations, \
  user credentials will need to be provided to allow for token revocation. If a pre-generated token was \
  specified during login, usually you'll want to pass this option to avoid the pre-generated token from \
  being revoked.

# fcli sc-dast session list
fcli.sc-dast.session.list.usage.header = List active and expired ScanCentral DAST sessions.
fcli.sc-dast.session.list.usage.description = This commands lists all ScanCentral DAST sessions created \
  through the `login` command, as long as they haven't been explicitly terminated through the 'logout' \
  command. For sessions created using user name and password, the output of this command will show \
  session expiry date and status. For sessions created using a pre-generated token, fcli cannot display \
  this information as SSC doesn't allow for obtaining this information.

# fcli sc-dast rest
fcli.sc-dast.rest.usage.header = Interact with ScanCentral DAST REST API endpoints.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.usage.description = These commands allow for direct interaction with ScanCentral DAST \
  REST API endpoints, somewhat similar to using 'curl' but benefiting from standard fcli functionality \
  like session management (no need to manually specify Authorization header), rich output formatting \
  options, and query functionality.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.usage.header = Call an individual Fortify ScanCentral DAST REST API endpoint. 
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.no-transform = By default, this command performs generic transformations on \
  ScanCentral DAST REST responses, like only outputting the actual response data (contents of the \
  'item' or 'items' property). Use this option to output the original response contents without transformations.

fcli.sc-dast.scan.start.login-macro = Overrides the scan login macro binary file id.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.header = Wait for one or more scans to reach or exit specified scan statuses.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.0 = Although this command offers a lot of options to cover many different use cases, you can simply pass a scan id (possibly stored using --store on the 'scan start' command) to wait for completion of a single scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.1 = %nIf none of the --while or --until options are specified, this command will by default wait until the scan has completed. If any error state or unknown state is detected, an exception will be thrown.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.2 = %nThe following states are currently known by fcli:
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.3 = ${fcli.sc-dast.scan.states:-See fcli help output}
fcli.sc-dast.scan.import-findings.usage.header = Import scan findings.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.import-findings.usage.description = This command imports scan findings into ScanCentral DAST.

Please see the ScanCentral DAST documentation for more information.   
fcli.sc-dast.scan.publish.usage.header = Publish scan results.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.publish.usage.description = This command publishes scan results to SSC. This can be used for publishing the results if 'Submit for Triage' was not enabled in the scan configuration.
