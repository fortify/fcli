* `fcli tool`: Add `fcli tool * install --base-dir` option to specify the base directory under which all tools will be installed. By default, fcli will now also install tool invocation scripts in a global `<base-dir>/bin` directory, unless the `--no-global-bin` option is specified.

* `fcli tool`: Add `fcli tool definitions` commands, allowing tool definitions to be updated to make fcli aware of new tool versions that were released after the current fcli release. Customers may also host customized tool definitions, for example allowing for alternative tool download URLs or restricting the set of tool versions available to end users. ([e2db51d](https://github.com/fortify/fcli/commit/e2db51d05567f9c7fcaa0bd96548b93fd69fea8a))
