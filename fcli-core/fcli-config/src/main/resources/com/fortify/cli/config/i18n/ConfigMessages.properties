# Make sure none of the commands inherit usage header or description of the top-level fcli command
# Note that we define these as usage.* whereas our parent bundle defines fcli.usage.* (with fcli prefix).
# For some reason, overriding fcli.usage.* doesn't work.

# fcli config
fcli.config.usage.header = Manage fcli configuration settings (proxy, trust store, ...).
fcli.config.usage.description = The commands in this module allow for managing configuration settings that may apply to multiple fcli modules. For example, this includes commands for managing proxy settings to allow fcli to connect to remote systems through a proxy server, and for configuring SSL trust store settings to allow fcli to connect to servers with self-signed certificates.  

# fcli config clear
fcli.config.clear.usage.header = Clear full fcli configuration.
fcli.config.clear.usage.description = This command deletes the fcli configuration directory, clearing configuration settings like language, proxy and trust store settings. Note that this does not clear current fcli state, like session and variable data; please use the 'fcli util state clear' command for clearing state data.

fcli.config.proxy.priority = Priority of this proxy configuration. If multiple configuration match the target module & URL, the proxy configuration with highest priority is used.
fcli.config.proxy.modules = Comma-separated list of fcli modules / target systems (fod, sc-dast, sc-sast, ssc, debricked, tool) on which to apply this proxy configuration.
fcli.config.proxy.include-hosts = Comma-separated list of target host names on which to apply this proxy configuration. Host names may include wildcard characters, like *.fortifyhosted.net.
fcli.config.proxy.exclude-hosts = Comma-separated list of target host names on which not to apply this proxy configuration. Host names may include wildcard characters, like *.myintra.net.

# fcli config public-key
fcli.config.public-key.usage.header = Manage fcli trusted public keys.
fcli.config.public-key.clear.usage.header = Clear all trusted public keys.
fcli.config.public-key.clear.confirm = Confirm clearing all trusted public keys.
fcli.config.public-key.delete.usage.header = Delete a trusted public key.
fcli.config.public-key.get.usage.header = Get trusted public key data.
fcli.config.public-key.import.usage.header = Import a trusted public key.
fcli.config.public-key.import.file = PEM file to be imported.
fcli.config.public-key.import.name = Name for the imported public key.
fcli.config.public-key.list.usage.header = List trusted public keys.
fcli.config.public-key.nameOrFingerprint = Public key name or fingerprint.
fcli.config.public-key.resolver = Public key to be imported into the fcli trusted public \
  key store. Can be specified as one of: \
  %n   file:<local file>%n   url:<url>%n   string:<string value>%n   env:<env-var name>\
  %n  If no prefix is given, <local file> is assumed. For security reasons, you should only \
  import trusted public keys from a trusted source. Independent of source, contents must be \
  in PEM (base64-encoded) format. For convenience with string: or env: inputs, the \
  'BEGIN/END PUBLIC KEY' statements and any whitespace (including newline characters) \
  may be omitted.
