usage:
  header: (PREVIEW) Set up application release. 
  description: |
    This action is primarily meant for use in CI/CD integrations, allowing users to 
    provide a custom action with a customized application release setup process. For 
    example, such a custom action could define standard profiles (based on team,
    business unit, application type/risk, ...) with predefined SDLC status and/or 
    scan setup. Of course, instead of having a single custom action that defines 
    profiles, you could also provide multiple custom actions that users can select 
    from, or you can use a combination; each business unit or team providing their 
    own custom action, with each of these custom actions defining profiles for 
    different application types/risk. This built-in action only provides a 'default' 
    profile that simply invokes the `fcli fod release create` and 
    `fcli fod sast-scan setup` commands with some default options, amended with
    options passed to this action.

defaults:
  requestTarget: fod
  
parameters:
  - name: release
    cliAliases: rel
    required: true
    description: "Required release name as <application>[:<microservice>]:<release>"
  - name: profile
    cliAliases: p
    required: true
    defaultValue: default
    description: "This built-in action only supports the 'default' profile, which is selected by default"
  - group: rel_create_opts
    required: false
    name: copy-from
    description: "See 'fcli fod release create'"
  - group: rel_create_opts
    required: false
    name: description
    cliAliases: d
    description: "See 'fcli fod release create'"
  - group: rel_create_opts
    required: true
    name: sdlc-status
    cliAliases: status
    description: "See 'fcli fod release create'"
    
  
steps:
  - progress: "Creating FoD application release if non-existing (profile: ${parameters.profile})"
  - if: ${parameters.profile=="default"}
    set:
      - name: relCreateArgs
        value: --skip-if-exists ${#action.copyParametersFromGroup("rel_create_opts")}
  # Custom actions can replace/repeat the above to define custom profiles.
  - if: ${relCreateArgs==null}
    throw: "Invalid profile: ${parameters.profile}"
  - fcli:
    - name: createRelease
      args: fod release create ${parameters.release} ${relCreateArgs}
  - write:
      - to: stdout
        value: |
          Create application release ${parameters.release} (id ${createRelease[0].releaseId}): ${createRelease[0].__action__}
