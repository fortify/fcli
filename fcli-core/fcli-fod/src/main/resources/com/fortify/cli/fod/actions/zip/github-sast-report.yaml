# For now, github-sast-report and sarif-report actions are exactly the same, apart from usage 
# information and default output file name. The reason for having two similar but separate 
# actions is two-fold:
# - We want to explicitly show that fcli supports both GitHub Code Scanning integration (which 
#   just happens to be based on SARIF) and generic SARIF capabilities.
# - Potentially, outputs for GitHub and generic SARIF may deviate in the future, for example if 
#   we want to add SARIF properties that are not supported by GitHub.
# Until the latter situation arises, we should make sure though that both actions stay in sync;
# when updating one, the other should also be updated. and ideally we should have functional tests
# that compare the outputs of both actions.
