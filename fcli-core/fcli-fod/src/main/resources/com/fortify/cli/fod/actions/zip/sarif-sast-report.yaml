# For now, github-sast-report and sarif-report actions are exactly the same, apart from the
# following:
# - Different usage information
# - Different default output file name 
# - The sarif-report doesn't impose a limit of 1000 issues
# The reason for having two similar but separate actions is two-fold:
# - We want to explicitly show that fcli supports both GitHub Code Scanning integration (which 
#   just happens to be based on SARIF) and generic SARIF capabilities.
# - Potentially, outputs for GitHub and generic SARIF may deviate in the future, for example if 
#   we want to add SARIF properties that are not supported by GitHub.
# Until the latter situation arises, we should make sure though that both actions stay in sync;
# when updating one, the other should also be updated. and ideally we should have functional tests
# that compare the outputs of both actions. 

usage:
  header: Generate SARIF report listing SSC SAST vulnerabilities.  
  description: |
    This action generates a SARIF report listing Fortify SAST vulnerabilities, which 
    may be useful for integration with various 3rd-party tools that can ingest SARIF 
    reports. For more information about SARIF, please see
    https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html
