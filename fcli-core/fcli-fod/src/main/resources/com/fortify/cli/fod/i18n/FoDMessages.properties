fcli.fod.session.login.usage.description.0 = This command stores the FoD URL and authentication \
  token in an encrypted session file in the fcli state data folder, for use by other 'fcli fod' \
  commands to connect to the specified FoD instance. Option values may be passed on the command \
  line or specified through environment variables (common for CI/CD pipeline use) as listed below.
fcli.fod.session.login.usage.description.1 = %nFor interactive use, you may choose to keep the session \
  open until it expires. For CI/CD integrations and other automations, you should always issue a \
  logout command once work is complete. On shared/non-containerized systems, consider setting \
  FCLI_STATE_DIR or FCLI_DATA_DIR environment variables to prevent unexpected interactions between \
  different pipelines.
fcli.fod.session.login.url.0 = FoD API URL, for example https://api.emea.fortify.com/.
fcli.fod.session.login.url.1 = Environment variable:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_FOD_URL

  command, as long as they haven't been explicitly terminated through the 'logout' command.

# fcli fod rest
fcli.fod.rest.usage.header = Interact with FoD REST API endpoints.
fcli.fod.rest.usage.description = These commands allow for direct interaction with FoD REST API endpoints, \
  somewhat similar to using 'curl' but benefiting from standard fcli functionality like session management \
  (no need to manually specify Authorization header), rich output formatting options, and query functionality.
fcli.fod.rest.call.usage.header = Call an individual FoD REST API endpoint.
fcli.fod.rest.call.no-paging = By default, this command will load all pages of data from FoD (from the \
  given offset if specified as a request parameter). Use this option to return only a single page. 
fcli.fod.rest.call.no-transform = By default, this command performs generic transformations on FoD REST \
  responses, like only outputting the actual response data (contents of the 'items' property). Use this \
  option to output the original response contents without transformations.
fcli.fod.rest.call.transform = This option allows for performing custom transformations on the response \
  data based on a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. For example, this allows for retrieving \
  data from sub-properties, or using project selection/projection. Note that the expression operates on \
  the raw response, as if --no-transform was specified before evaluating the expression.

fcli.fod.rest.lookup.usage.header = Retrieve FoD REST API lookup values.
fcli.fod.rest.lookup.usage.description = Use this command to retrieve the values of lookup items (types) \

fcli.fod.action.run.confirm = Confirm running an action with invalid signature.
fcli.fod.action.run.confirmPrompt = %s%nDo you still want to run this action?
fcli.fod.action.sign.confirm = Confirm overwriting existing output file.
fcli.fod.action.sign.confirmPrompt = Do you want overwrite existing output file %s?

fcli.action.source.single = The action can be specified as either a simple name or a local or \
  remote action YAML file location. If specified as a simple name, the action will be loaded from \
  the list of built-in and imported custom actions unless the `--from-zip` option is specified, \
  in which case the action will be loaded from the given local or remote zip file. The `--from-zip` \
  option will be ignored if the action is specified as a local or remote action YAML file location.
fcli.fod.action.usage.description = Fcli supports workflow-style actions defined in YAML files. Many \
  built-in actions are provided, focusing on data export and CI/CD integration. Users can also develop \
  their own custom actions, either from scratch or by customizing built-in actions. Note though that \
  the ability to run custom actions is currently considered PREVIEW functionality; custom actions \
  developed for this fcli version may fail on other fcli versions. We will stabilize action syntax \
  over the next couple of fcli versions, and provide proper backward compatibility so that newer \
  fcli versions can run actions developed for older fcli versions. \
  %n%nActions can potentially perform dangerous operations like deleting data or posting data to 3rd-party \
  systems, so it is recommended to only run trusted actions. Action authors can sign their actions using \
  the `action sign` command; actions without a (valid) signature will require confirmation when trying to \
  run them. Trusted public keys can be configured through the `fcli config public-key` commands.
fcli.fod.action.get.usage.description = This command allows for listing the YAML contents of built-in or \
  custom actions. This allows for reviewing the operations performed by an action, or for using the action \
  contents as a basis for developing custom actions. \
  %n%n${fcli.action.source.single}
fcli.fod.action.help.usage.description = This command allows for showing the help information for the given \
  built-in or custom action. \
  ${fcli.action.source.single}
fcli.fod.action.import.usage.description = Import one or more custom actions. You can import either a single \
  action YAML file, or a zip-file containing one or more action YAML files. Imported actions will take precedence \
  over built-in action if they have the same name. \
  %n%n${fcli.action.source.single}. \
  If only `--from-zip` is specified, all actions from that zip-file will be imported.
fcli.fod.action.list.usage.description = By default, this command lists available built-in and \
  previously imported custom actions. If the `--from-zip` option is specified, this command \
  lists available actions from the given local or remote zip file instead.
fcli.fod.action.run.usage.description = This command allows for running built-in or custom actions. As actions \
  may perform potentially dangerous operations like deleting data or posting data to 3rd-party systems, you should \
  only run trusted actions. For this reason, fcli requires confirmation when attempting to run an action without \
  a (valid) signature. \
  %n%n${fcli.action.source.single}
fcli.fod.action.sign.usage.description = This command allows for signing custom actions, allowing those actions to \
  be run without confirmation if the corresponding public key has been imported through the `fcli config public-key` \
  commands. Contrary to other action commands, the action to be signed must be a local file. \
  %n%nThis command can use an existing private key for signing, or generate a new key pair if the \
  private key file as specified through the `--with` option doesn't yet exist and `--pubout` is \
  specified to output the corresponding public key. \
  %n%nPrivate keys may also be generated using OpenSSL or similar tools, but note that only RSA keys in PEM format are supported, \
  and only a small set of encryption schemes are supported for encrypted private keys. It is recommended to use AES \
  encryption, which is supported by both native fcli executables and the .jar version of fcli. The latter requires \
  Java 19 or above though to handle AES-encrypted private keys. Following is a sample OpenSSL command for generating an \
  encrypted private key that's supported by fcli for signing: %n  openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out private-key.pem -aes256 \
  %n%nFor convenience, when using a pre-existing private key, the `--pubout` option allows for outputting the corresponding \
  public key for use by the `fcli config public-key import` command. Note that public keys will not be automatically added \
  to the fcli trusted public key store; even if this command generates a key pair on the fly, you'll still need to import \
  the generated public key using the `fcli config public-key import` command.
