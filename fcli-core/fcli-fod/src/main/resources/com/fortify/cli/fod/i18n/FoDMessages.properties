  data based on a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. For example, this allows for retrieving \

  Command name, options and behavior may change at any time, even between patch or minor releases, potentially affecting \
  any workflows in which this command is being used.
fcli.fod.sast-scan.setup.usage.description.1 = To correctly setup a scan you will need to provide the name of the \
  assessment type using the '--assessment-type=xxx' option. Since assessment types can potentially be configured \
  differently for each tenant, you can find the correct name using the 'fod assessment-type list' command.
fcli.fod.sast-scan.setup.usage.description.2 = If you know the Id of an entitlement that you want to use then you \
  can supply it to the '--entitlement-id=xxx' option. If not, you can supply both '--assessment-type' and \
  '--entitlement-frequency' options and the command will try to find an appropriate entitlement.
fcli.fod.sast-scan.setup.usage.description.3 = For the '--technology-stack' and '--language-level' options it is \
  recommended to examine the drop-down list values in the FoD UI. However, you can also use the 'fod rest lookup' command. \
  For example, to list all the technology stacks you would use 'fod rest lookup TechnologyTypes' and then for the \
  language levels (if appropriate) you would use the 'Value' field returned in 'fod rest lookup LanguageLevels'. \
  For example, for Java which is typically value '7', you would use 'fod rest lookup LanguageLevels -q "group=='7'".

fcli.fod.sast-scan.import.file = FPR file containing existing SAST scan results to be imported.
fcli.fod.sast-scan.download.usage.header = Download scan results.
