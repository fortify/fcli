# Shared resources
fcli.tool.install.platform = By default, fcli will try to install tool binaries that match the current operating system \
  & architecture. Use this option to override automatic platform detection. The list-platforms command lists available \
  platforms.
fcli.tool.install.version = Tool version to install; see output of list command to view available versions. \
  Default value: ${DEFAULT-VALUE} 
fcli.tool.install.install-dir = Tool installation directory. Deprecated, use --tools-dir instead.
fcli.tool.install.base-dir = Directory under which the tool will be installed. Defaults to ~/fortify. \
  Tools will be installed to <base-dir>/<tool>/<version>.
fcli.tool.install.on-digest-mismatch = Action to take if there is a digest mismatch. Allowed values: \
  ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}. Default action is to fail. 
fcli.tool.install.uninstall = Uninstall the given versions while installing the new version. Accepts \
  'all' to uninstall all existing versions, or a comma-separated list of version numbers. Version numbers may be \
  specified as <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>]].
fcli.tool.install.global-bin = By default, wrapper scripts will be installed to <base-dir>/bin; use --no-global-bin \
  to skip installing/updating these wrapper scripts.
fcli.tool.uninstall.versions = One or more tool version to uninstall. Accepts \
  'all' to uninstall all existing versions, or a comma-separated list of version numbers. Version numbers may be \
  specified as <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>]].
fcli.tool.list-platforms.version = Tool version for which to list available platforms.
fcli.tool.install.confirmPrompt = Actions to be performed: %s\nConfirm?
fcli.tool.definitions.update.definitions-source = URL or file to get the tool definitions from. If not specified, \
  default tool definitions provided by OpenText are downloaded from a predefined URL.
fcli.tool.definitions.update.max-definitions-age = Only update tool definitions if the current definitions are older \
  than the specified maximum age, for example 0s (0 seconds, force update), 4h (4 hours) or 1d (1 day), to avoid \
  downloading the definitions multiple times in a short period of time. Default value: ${DEFAULT-VALUE} 
fcli.tool.uninstall.confirmPrompt = Actions to be performed: %s\nConfirm?

fcli.tool.install.generic-description = This command allows for tool installation and upgrade. All tools are installed \
  to <base-dir>/<tool-name>/<version>. The base directory can be specified using the --base-dir option, defaulting \
  to <user.home>/fortify/tools if not specified. Unless the --no-global-bin option is specified, wrapper scripts for \
  invoking each tool will be installed to <base-dir>/bin, allowing users to add this directory to the system PATH for \
  easy tool invocations. \
  \n\nWhen installing a new version, older versions can optionally be automatically un-installed using the --uninstall \
  option, which is basically the equivalent of an upgrade. When trying to install a version that's already been installed, \
  only some post-installation tasks will be re-run, like installing the global bin scripts and performing any tool \
  configuration if applicable. \
  \n\nSample invocations: \
  \n\nInstall latest tool version, keep older versions: \
  \n  fcli tool <name> install -v latest \
  \n\nInstall latest tool version (only re-running post-install if already existing), uninstall all other tool versions: \
  \n  fcli tool <name> install -v latest --uninstall all \
  \n\nInstall latest v2 version, uninstall all other v2 versions: \
  \n  fcli tool <name> install -v 2 --uninstall 2 \
  \n\nInstall latest and latest v1, have global bin-scripts point to latest: \
  \n  fcli tool <name> install -v latest \
  \n  fcli tool <name> install -v 1 --no-global-bin 
  
fcli.tool.uninstall.generic-global-bin-description = Note that global bin scripts, if installed, will not be updated \
  or removed by this command. If you un-install the version to which the global bin-script is currently pointing, \
  the global bin script will cease functioning. To update the global bin script to point to an existing version, \
  please use the install command.

# fcli tool

#fcli tool definitions
fcli.tool.definitions.generic-description = Tool definitions list the available versions, corresponding download \
  location, and other details for each tool. These tool definitions are used by the various 'fcli tool' commands \
  to identify what tool versions are currently available and where to download them from. By default, each fcli \
  release ships with the latest tool definitions that were available at the time that release was built.  
fcli.tool.definitions.usage.header = Manage tool definitions
fcli.tool.definitions.usage.description.0 = ${fcli.tool.definitions.generic-description}\n

fcli.tool.definitions.update.usage.description.1 = The update command allows for updating the tool definitions from \
  a URL or local file. This allows for the current fcli installation to be aware of new tool versions that were \
  released after the current fcli release was built, and also allows users to use a custom tool definitions bundle.\n
fcli.tool.definitions.update.usage.description.2 = For example, if it's not allowed to download tool \
  installation bundles from public sites like github.com or tools.fortify.com, companies can host tool installation \
  bundles internally and provide a tool definitions bundle that points to the internally hosted installation bundles. \
  At the same time, companies can restrict which versions of each tool users are allowed to install.
