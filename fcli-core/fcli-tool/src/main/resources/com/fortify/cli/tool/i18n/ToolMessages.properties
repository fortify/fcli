fcli.tool.definitions.update.usage.description.2 = For example, if it's not allowed to download tool \
  installation bundles from public sites like github.com or tools.fortify.com, companies can host tool installation \
  bundles internally and provide a tool definitions bundle that points to the internally hosted installation bundles. \
  At the same time, companies can restrict which versions of each tool users are allowed to install.
