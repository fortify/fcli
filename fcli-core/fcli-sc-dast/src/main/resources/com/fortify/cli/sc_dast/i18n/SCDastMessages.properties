# fcli sc-dast
fcli.sc-dast.usage.header = Interact with Fortify ScanCentral DAST (SC-DAST).
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.0 = The commands in this module allow for interacting with \
  Fortify ScanCentral DAST (SC-DAST). This includes functionality like submitting and \
  managing DAST scan requests and results.
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.1 = %nBefore being able to interact with ScanCentral DAST, \
  a session will need to be created by passing SSC URL and credentials to the 'session login' \
  command in this module. As a best practice, 'session logout' should be run to terminate the \
  session when there are no more activities to be performed.  

# Shared options
fcli.sc-dast.server-queries = Complementary to the -q / --query option (which performs client-side \
  filtering), this option accepts one or more comma-separated ScanCentral DAST request parameters \
  to perform server-side filtering, for example 'searchText=some-text'. See the ScanCentral DAST \
  API documentation for information on which request parameters are supported on individual endpoints. 

# fcli sc-dast session
fcli.sc-dast.session.usage.header = Manage ScanCentral DAST sessions (start here).
fcli.sc-dast.session.usage.description = The session commands allow for managing one or more \
  ScanCentral DAST sessions used to connect to a particular SSC/ScanCentral DAST environment \
  with particular credentials. Potentially you can have multiple open ScanCentral DAST sessions, \
  for example connecting to different SSC/ScanCentral DAST environments like DEV and PROD, \
  or connecting to the same SSC/ScanCentral DAST instance but with different credentials.
  
# Shared login options
ssc-user.0 = SSC user name.
ssc-user.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_USER: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_USER: Only SC DAST commands
ssc-password.0 = SSC password.
ssc-password.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_PASSWORD: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_PASSWORD: Only SC DAST commands
ssc-ci-token.0 = SSC CIToken in either encoded (REST) or decoded (application) format.
ssc-ci-token.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Only SC DAST commands

# fcli sc-dast session login
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.header = Create a session for interacting with ScanCentral DAST.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.description.0 = This command stores the SSC and ScanCentral DAST API \
  URL and authentication token in an encrypted session file in the fcli state data folder, for use \
  by other 'fcli sc-dast' commands to connect to the specified SSC/ScanCentral DAST instance. Option \
  values may be passed on the command line or specified through environment variables (common for \
  CI/CD pipeline use) as listed below.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.description.1 = %nWhen logging in with username and password, this \
  command will connect to SSC to generate a CIToken; the user password is not stored by fcli. When \
  logging in with a pre-generated CIToken, this token will be stored as-is. Note that due to SSC \
  limitations, fcli cannot determine when the token will expire.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.usage.description.2 = %nFor interactive use, you may choose to keep the session \
  open until it expires. For CI/CD integrations and other automations, you should always issue a \
  logout command once work is complete. On shared/non-containerized systems, consider setting \
  FCLI_STATE_DIR or FCLI_DATA_DIR environment variables to prevent unexpected interactions between \
  different pipelines.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.expire-in = Specify for how long the session should remain active, for example \
  1d (1 day), 2M (2 months), 1y (1 year).
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.ssc-url.0 = SSC URL.
fcli.sc-dast.session.login.ssc-url.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_URL: Shared with SSC/SC SAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SC_DAST_SSC_URL: Only SC DAST commands

# fcli sc-dast session logout
fcli.sc-dast.session.logout.usage.header = Terminate ScanCentral DAST session.
fcli.sc-dast.session.logout.usage.description = This command terminates a ScanCentral DAST session \
  previously created through the 'login' command. This command will try to revoke the token passed \
  to or generated by the 'login' command (unless the --no-revoke-token option is specified), and \
  removes the session data from the fcli state data directory. 
fcli.sc-dast.session.logout.no-revoke-token = Don't revoke the token passed to or generated by the 'login' \
  command. If user name and password were specified during login, it is recommended to have the 'logout' \
  command revoke this token, to avoid exceeding SSCs maximum token limit. Note that due to SSC limitations, \
  user credentials will need to be provided to allow for token revocation. If a pre-generated token was \
  specified during login, usually you'll want to pass this option to avoid the pre-generated token from \
  being revoked.

# fcli sc-dast session list
fcli.sc-dast.session.list.usage.header = List active and expired ScanCentral DAST sessions.
fcli.sc-dast.session.list.usage.description.0 = This commands lists all ScanCentral DAST sessions created through the `login` \
  command, as long as they haven't been explicitly terminated through the 'logout' command. %n
fcli.sc-dast.session.list.usage.description.1 = For sessions created using user name and password, the output \
  of this command will show session expiry date and status, based on the data provided by SSC at the time \
  the login command was issued. Any changes to the generated token will not be reflected in the output of \
  this command. Even if a session is no longer valid because the generated token was revoked (through SSC \
  UI or 'fcli ssc access-control revoke-token' command), the output of this command may still show the session as not having \
  expired. Similarly, any changes to token validity will not be reflected in the output of this command. %n
fcli.sc-dast.session.list.usage.description.2 = For sessions created using a pre-generated token, fcli cannot \
  display session expiration date or status, as SSC doesn't allow for obtaining this information.


# fcli sc-dast rest
fcli.sc-dast.rest.usage.header = Interact with ScanCentral DAST REST API endpoints.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.usage.description = These commands allow for direct interaction with ScanCentral DAST \
  REST API endpoints, somewhat similar to using 'curl' but benefiting from standard fcli functionality \
  like session management (no need to manually specify Authorization header), rich output formatting \
  options, and query functionality.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.usage.header = Call an individual Fortify ScanCentral DAST REST API endpoint. 
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.no-paging = By default, this command will load all pages of data from ScanCentral \
  DAST (from the given offset if specified as a request parameter). Use this option to return only a \
  single page. 
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.no-transform = By default, this command performs generic transformations on \
  ScanCentral DAST REST responses, like only outputting the actual response data (contents of the \
  'item' or 'items' property). Use this option to output the original response contents without transformations.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.transform = This option allows for performing custom transformations on the response \
  data based on a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. For example, this allows for retrieving \
  data from sub-properties, or using project selection/projection. Note that the expression operates on \
  the raw response, as if --no-transform was specified before evaluating the expression.

# fcli sc-dast scan
scan-id's[0] = One or more scan id's.
scan-id[0] = Single scan id.

fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.header = Wait for one or more scans to reach or exit specified scan statuses.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.0 = Although this command offers a lot of options to cover many \
  different use cases, you can simply pass a scan id (possibly stored using --store on the 'scan start' \
  command) to wait for completion of a single scan. If any error state or unknown state is detected, an \
  exception will be thrown.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.1 = %nThe following states are currently known by fcli:
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.2 = ${fcli.sc-dast.scan.states:-See fcli help output}
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.until=Wait until either any or all scans match. If neither --until or --while are specified, default is to wait until all scans match.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.while=Wait while either any or all scans match.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.any-state=One or more scan states against which to match the given scans.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.import-findings.usage.header = Import scan findings.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.import-findings.usage.description = This command imports scan findings into ScanCentral DAST. With ScanCentral DAST, scan findings are usually imported automatically, but there may be cases where this operation needs to be triggered explicitly. Please see the ScanCentral DAST documentation for more information.   
fcli.sc-dast.scan.publish.usage.header = Publish scan results.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.publish.usage.description = This command publishes scan results to SSC. This can be used for publishing the results if 'Submit for Triage' was not enabled in the scan configuration.
