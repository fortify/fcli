# Generic, non command-specific options
fcli.genericOptions.heading = Generic fcli options:%n
help = Show this help message and exit. Use 'fcli <command> -h' to display help for subcommands.
version = Print version information and exit.
env-prefix = Environment variable prefix for resolving default option and parameter values. \
  Default value is ${DEFAULT-VALUE}.
log-level = Set logging level. Note that DEBUG and TRACE levels may result in sensitive data \
  being written to the log file. Allowed values: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
log-file = File where logging data will be written. Defaults to fcli.log in current directory \
  if --log-level is specified.

# Generic, non command-specific output and query options
arggroup.output.heading = Output options:%n
output = Specify output format and options. Available output formats: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}. \
  The 'expr' output format takes a string containing '{property}' placeholders, other output \

  '-o json-properties' on the current command to see available properties.
to-file = Write command output to the specified file instead of stdout.
store = Store the JSON results of this command in a variable. Variables can be managed through \
  the 'fcli util variable' command, and can be referenced using ::variable::[property] on any \
  subsequent command. 
query = Only display records for which the given Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression returns true. 

# Options and prompts defined in CommonOptionMixins

fcli.confirmPromptOptions = Y/N
fcli.expectedConfirmPromptResponse = Y

# Options defined in AbstractReportGenerateCommand
report-dir = Write report output to the given directory.
report-zip = Write report output to the given zip-file.

# Default usage header & description. Effectively, these are only applied to 
# the top-level fcli command as each module-specific resource bundle overrides
# these default usage header & description with empty values. See the following

usage.header = Command-line interface for working with various Fortify products.
usage.description.0 = As the name implies, Fortify CLI (fcli) is a general-purpose command-line \
  utility for working with the various Fortify products. 
usage.description.1 = %nFortify CLI is structured using sub-commands, based on the following \
  convention: 'fcli <module> <entity> <action>'. Every sub-command provides its own detailed usage \
  instructions, accessible through the -h or --help option on each sub-command. Where applicable, \
  the usage instructions include the list of sub-commands. For example, the Commands section below \
  displays the sub-commands representing the various fcli modules. A list of all available fcli \
  commands can be obtained through the 'fcli util all-commands list' command.    
usage.description.2 = %nIt is highly recommended to review the fcli user documentation, which \
  both explains general fcli concepts and provides detailed instructions on particular topics like \
  common command line options and use of environment variables and fcli variables. The link to the \
  online documentation can be found at the bottom of the help output for every individual fcli \
  command, as seen below.
