  %nThis Q environment variable is used by the various fcli commands listed below to select either \
  an individual release or all (non-prerelease) releases. \
  %n%nSpecific release tag (see output of 'fcli util github lsr'): \
  %n export Q='release.tag_name=="v2.0.0"' \
  %nSubset of tags, for example starting with a major version number: \
  %n export Q='release.tag_name.startsWith("4.")' \
