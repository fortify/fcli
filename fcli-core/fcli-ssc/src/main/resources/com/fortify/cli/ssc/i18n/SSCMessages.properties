# fcli ssc
fcli.ssc.usage.header = Interact with Fortify Software Security Center (SSC).
fcli.ssc.usage.description.0 = The commands in this module allow for interacting with \
  Fortify Software Security Center (SSC). This includes functionality like managing \
  applications, application versions and their contents like artifacts and vulnerability \
  data, as well as working with other SSC entities like event logs, alerts, plugins, and so on.  
fcli.ssc.usage.description.1 = %nBefore being able to interact with SSC, a session will need \
  to be created by passing SSC URL and credentials to the 'session login' command in this \
  module. As a best practice, 'session logout' should be run to terminate the session when \
  there are no more activities to be performed.  

# Shared options
delim = Change the default delimiter character when using options that accept \
  "application:version" as an argument or parameter. 
download.no-include-sources = Sources are included by default; use --no-include-sources to \
  download artifact without sources.
upload.filePath = The path to the file to be uploaded.
allow-multi-match = Allow for multiple matches.
fcli.ssc.q-param = Server-side queries are automatically generated from the -q / --query option \
  if possible; generated queries can be viewed in the debug log. The --q-param option can be used \
  to override the automatically generated query, for example to further optimize the request. See \
  SSC REST API documentation for information on supported formats.

# fcli ssc session
user.0 = SSC user name.
user.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_USER: Shared with SC SAST/DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_SESSION_USER: Only SSC session commands
password.0 = SSC password.
password.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_PASSWORD: Shared with SC SAST/DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_SESSION_PASSWORD: Only SSC session commands
ci-token.0 = SSC CIToken in either encoded (REST) or decoded (application) format. \
  Tokens can be created through the SSC web UI, or using the \
  'fcli ssc token create' command. Note that most, but not all, fcli commands \
  are available when logging in with a CIToken.
ci-token.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_CI_TOKEN: Shared with SC SAST/DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_SESSION_CI_TOKEN: Only SSC session commands

fcli.ssc.session.usage.header = Manage SSC sessions (start here).
fcli.ssc.session.usage.description = The session commands allow for managing one or more \
  SSC sessions used to connect to a particular SSC instance with particular credentials. \
  Potentially you can have multiple open SSC sessions, for example connecting to different \
  SSC instances like DEV and PROD, or connecting to the same SSC instance but with different \
  credentials.
  
fcli.ssc.session.login.usage.header = Create a session for interacting with Fortify SSC.
fcli.ssc.session.login.usage.description.0 = This command stores the SSC URL and authentication \
  token in an encrypted session file in the fcli state data folder, for use by other 'fcli ssc' \
  commands to connect to the specified SSC instance. Option values may be passed on the command \
  line or specified through environment variables (common for CI/CD pipeline use) as listed below.
fcli.ssc.session.login.usage.description.1 = %nWhen logging in with username and password, this \
  command will connect to SSC to generate a UnifiedLoginToken; the user password is not stored \
  by fcli. When logging in with a pre-generated token, this token will be stored as-is. Note \
  that due to SSC limitations, fcli cannot validate whether the given token is a valid SSC token, \
  and doesn't known when it will expire. If an invalid or expired token is given, the 'login' \
  command may still succeed but subsequent 'fcli ssc' commands will fail. Also note that depending \
  on token type, some 'fcli ssc' commands may fail due to the token not being allowed to access \
  the necessary SSC API endpoints.
fcli.ssc.session.login.usage.description.2 = %nFor interactive use, you may choose to keep the session \
  open until it expires. For CI/CD integrations and other automations, you should always issue a \
  logout command once work is complete. On shared/non-containerized systems, consider setting \
  FCLI_STATE_DIR or FCLI_DATA_DIR environment variables to prevent unexpected interactions between \
  different pipelines.
fcli.ssc.session.login.expire-in = Specify for how long the session should remain active, for example \
  1h (1 hour), 1d (1 day).
fcli.ssc.session.login.url.0 = SSC URL.

  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_URL: Shared with SC SAST/DAST%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_SESSION_URL: Only SSC session commands 
fcli.ssc.session.login.token.0 = SSC token in either encoded (REST) or decoded (application) format. \
   Tokens can be created through the SSC web UI, or using the \
  'fcli ssc token create' command. Note that depending on token permissions, not all fcli \
  commands may be available.
fcli.ssc.session.login.token.1 = Environment variables:%n \
  ${fcli.env.default.prefix}_SSC_TOKEN
  
fcli.ssc.session.logout.usage.header = Terminate Fortify SSC session.
fcli.ssc.session.logout.usage.description = This command terminates an SSC session previously created \
  through the 'login' command. This command will try to revoke the token passed to or generated by the \
  'login' command (unless the --no-revoke-token option is specified), and removes the session data from \
  the fcli state data directory. 
fcli.ssc.session.logout.no-revoke-token = Don't revoke the token passed to or generated by the 'login' \
  command. If user name and password were specified during login, it is recommended to have the 'logout' \
  command revoke this token, to avoid exceeding SSCs maximum token limit. Note that due to SSC limitations, \
  user credentials will need to be provided to allow for token revocation. If a pre-generated token was \
  specified during login, usually you'll want to pass this option to avoid the pre-generated token from \
  being revoked.
  
fcli.ssc.session.list.usage.header = List active and expired Fortify SSC sessions.
fcli.ssc.session.list.usage.description.0 = This commands lists all SSC sessions created through the `login` \
  command, as long as they haven't been explicitly terminated through the 'logout' command. %n
fcli.ssc.session.list.usage.description.1 = For sessions created using user name and password, the output \
  of this command will show session expiry date and status, based on the data provided by SSC at the time \
  the login command was issued. Any changes to the generated token will not be reflected in the output of \
  this command. Even if a session is no longer valid because the generated token was revoked (through SSC \
  UI or 'fcli ssc token revoke' command), the output of this command may still show the session as not having \
  expired. Similarly, any changes to token validity will not be reflected in the output of this command. %n
fcli.ssc.session.list.usage.description.2 = For sessions created using a pre-generated token, fcli cannot \
  display session expiration date or status, as SSC doesn't allow for obtaining this information.

# fcli ssc rest
fcli.ssc.rest.usage.header = Interact with SSC REST API endpoints.
fcli.ssc.rest.usage.description = These commands allow for direct interaction with SSC REST API endpoints, \
  somewhat similar to using 'curl' but benefiting from standard fcli functionality like session management \
  (no need to manually specify Authorization header), rich output formatting options, and query functionality.
fcli.ssc.rest.call.usage.header = Call an individual Fortify SSC REST API endpoint. 
fcli.ssc.rest.call.no-paging = By default, this command will load all pages of data from SSC \
  (from the given offset if specified as a request parameter). Use this option to return only a \
  single page. 
fcli.ssc.rest.call.no-transform = By default, this command performs generic transformations on SSC REST \
  responses, like only outputting the actual response data (contents of the 'data' property). Use this \
  option to output the original response contents without transformations.
fcli.ssc.rest.call.transform = This option allows for performing custom transformations on the response \
  data based on a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. For example, this allows for retrieving \
  data from sub-properties, or using project selection/projection. Note that the expression operates on \
  the raw response, as if --no-transform was specified before evaluating the expression.

  versions. However, the --embed, --query and --output options allow for implementing advanced use cases. \
  Some examples: \
  %n%n List application versions created by user 'admin': \
  %n -q 'createdBy=="admin"' \
