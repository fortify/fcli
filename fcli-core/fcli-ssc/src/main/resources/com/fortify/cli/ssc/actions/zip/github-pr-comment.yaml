  header: (PREVIEW) Add GitHub Pull Request review comments.  
  description: |
      This action adds review comments to a GitHub Pull Request. Currently
      this is marked as PREVIEW as we build out this functionality; later
      versions may have different behavior and/or require different action
      parameters. 
      
      The current implementation simply compares current scan results 
      against previous scan results in the given SSC application version, 
      listing all new, re-introduced and removed issues in a new PR comment. 
      
      For best results, this fcli action should only be run on GitHub 
      pull_request triggers. Upon PR creation, a new SSC application version 
      should be created, copying state from the SSC application version that 
      represents the branch into which the PR will be merged, and a new scan 
      should be run on the current PR branch before invoking this fcli action.
      
      This will ensure that scan results for the current PR will be
      compared against the latest scan results for the target branch
      upon PR creation. Optionally, new scans can be run upon PR changes,
      creating new PR comments that show the issue delta compared to the
      previous scan for this PR.
